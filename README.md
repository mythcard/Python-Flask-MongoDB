Transactional Check Out System

It uses **Docker-compose**:
Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

After installing Docker and Docker-compose on your machine, you can go to the project main folder and type:

 `$sudo docker-compose up`


**Docker-compose** will build the containers necessary for your environment. Basically there will be two containers, one with Python, Flask and a few modules and another container with MongoDB bound to the first.
The environment structure is as follow:


app/
  
(You need to create a directory /app in your local harddrive. This is where you will keep your app.py Flask file for development.)  

data/

Dockerfiles/

docker-compose-yml


Within the **app** folder, there is an app.py file which is file that starts Flask.



If everything works fine, you should be able to connect to a simple page (Hello World) at:


http://localhost:5000


the other folders are necessary for:

**data** -> mongodb folder (shared with Mongo's Container)

**Dockerfiles** -> the Dockerfiles which create the containers, any change on each container can be done by editing these files

**docker-compose-yml** -> is the orquestrator that starts building the containers and link them up.
